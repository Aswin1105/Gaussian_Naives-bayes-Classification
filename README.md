# Gaussian_Naives-bayes-Classification
Clustering using popular Titanic dataset
Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying 
Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between 
every pair of features given the value of the class variable

Dataset is encoded using label encoder in sklearn preprocessing package
Also single input like from user, output categories can be easily predicted
We are also going to implement this Supervised Algorithm using package generated dataset and compare with other ML Algo
